# MCP Portal

A modern web interface for managing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, agents, tasks, and wiki pages.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Secure cookie-based authentication with identity provider
- **MCP Catalog**: Browse and manage MCP servers with their capabilities
- **Agents**: Create and manage AI agents with custom models and system prompts
- **Tasks**: Kanban-style task board with status tracking, tags, and comments
- **Context**: Knowledge base with markdown support for documentation pages

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Backend server running (see `apps/backend`)
- Test user created in the database

### Setup

1. **Create a test user** (first time only):
   ```bash
   cd apps/backend
   npm run init-test-user
   ```

   This creates a test user with the following credentials:
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`

2. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd apps/backend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Start the MCP Portal** (in a new terminal):
   ```bash
   cd apps/mcp-portal
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the portal**:
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:5174`
   - Login with the test credentials above

## Development

### Project Structure

│   ├── context/         # React context providers

│   │   └── Context.tsx  # Context pages
│   └── Layouts/         # Page layouts
```

### API Integration

The portal uses OpenAPI-generated clients from the `shared` package. All API services are configured in `src/lib/api.ts` with automatic cookie-based authentication.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

This builds the app and copies the production build to `apps/backend/dist/public-mcp` for serving by the backend.
